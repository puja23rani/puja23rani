I'm a Full Stack Developer passionate about building scalable, user-focused applications.  
I started my journey as a React developer and gradually expanded into full-stack development using the MERN stack.  
Currently, I work with **Next.js**, **NestJS**, and **Electron**, combining modern frontend frameworks with robust backend architectures.  

My experience spans **SQL and NoSQL databases**, RESTful APIs, and cloud integration with **AWS**.  
I enjoy optimizing performance, improving developer experience, and exploring new technologies that enhance product quality and scalability.  

üí° Always eager to learn, collaborate, and bring ideas to life.
